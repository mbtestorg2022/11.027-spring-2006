_Assignment 1  
_  
Can you think of three planning topics that interest you? What do you want to know more about? Is there a problem that you want to see fixed? Can Boston learn from Copenhagen? Can Copenhagen learn from Boston?  
  
\- Create a 5 minute visual presentation (not too many words please, mostly images) on a planning issue of interest to you. Try to focus on Boston and Copenhagen as you think about your issue. You should pull images from places like GoogleTM image or the various Boston and Copenhagen Web sites available. Students will pick a time to present over the next two classes.  
  
\- As part of preparing your presentation, you will most likely have a few questions about topics, Denmark and yourself. Write down all of these questions in your research notebook. Then, pull out at least 5 questions for our Guest Jacob Friis from the Royal Danish Consulate, Boston.

Make a list of 5 people that you could talk to about your topic idea here in the U.S. Write a paragraph on each person describing their backgrounds. These people can be DUSP faculty, DUSP alumni/ae or other individuals. The instructors can help with suggestions. This is a good time to set up an interviewing time with 1 or 2 of these people. Remember they all have busy schedules and you need to interview at least 1 by Week #5.

_Assignment 5_  
  
Now that you have written your 1 page proposal and you have interviewed an expert, you need to begin focusing on your research angle when you get to Copenhagen. We can use writing as a way to focus and shape your ideas. Craft a written 2-page paper that discusses the history of the issue as it is being addressed in Copenhagen. Structure the paper as follows:  
  
\- 2-3 paragraphs on the history of the issue in Copenhagen.  
\- 2-3 paragraphs on the current thoughts on your issue in Copenhagen.  
\- 2-3 paragraphs on the method you plan to use to study the issue in Copenhagen.  
  
Include at least 3 references (only one of which can be a Web site).

\- To orient you to your new environment, means of transportation and feel of the city, and  
\- To allow you to get comfortable working with your group on your fact-finding missions, and  
\- To have fun.  
  
2\. Meetings: The trip will include meetings with planners, particularly DUSP alumni/ae in that City so that you can ask questions and get answers about where and how best to focus your limited time within the City. You must prepare ahead of time a list of questions for the planner(s).
